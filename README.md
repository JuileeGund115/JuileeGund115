# Hey there, I’m Juilee Gund 👋

🔍 I’m a cybersecurity grad diving deep into red teaming, penetration testing, and all things offensive security.

💻 Currently sharpening my skills with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Burpsuite, Metasploit, Nessus, Aircrack-ng, and AFL++ — yes, I *do* enjoy fuzzing things until they break.

🎓 MSc Cybersecurity @ University of Birmingham  
📜 Google Cybersecurity Cert | CompTIA Security+ (in progress)

*Always learning. Sometimes breaking. Always documenting it before IT yells at me.*
