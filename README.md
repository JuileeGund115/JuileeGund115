# Hey there, I’m Juilee Gund 👋

🔍 Breaking things (ethically) to make the digital world safer — one port scan at a time.  
I’m a cybersecurity grad diving deep into red teaming, penetration testing, and all things offensive security.

💻 Currently sharpening my skills with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Aircrack-ng, Bettercap, and AFL++ — yes, I *do* enjoy fuzzing things until they break.

👩‍🔬 I’ve run simulations in SIEM/EDR environments, audited systems for ISO 27001/NIST/SOC 2 compliance, and even hacked an IoT device to make it behave (nicely).

## 🛠️ Some things I’ve built, broken, or fixed:
- 🔧 Pen-tested a smart home device (spoiler: it wasn’t that smart).
- 🧠 Simulated threat detection using MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- 🤖 Built a fuzzing tool using AFL++ to crash-test web APIs.
- 📋 Helped reduce audit chaos with clear policies and risk treatment plans.

*Always learning. Sometimes breaking. Always documenting it before IT yells at me.*
